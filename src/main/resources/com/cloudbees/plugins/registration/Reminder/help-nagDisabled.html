    <p>
    The “Your system is not registered with CloudBees” reminder bar is displayed whenever there are no valid system or
    global credentials for a CloudBees user. The “Remind me later” button will hide the reminder bar for 10 minutes.
    In general it is recommended to add the details of a CloudBees account in order to enable the full functionality
    of the CloudBees plugins.</p>
    <p>
    However, if this Jenkins instance does not have direct internet access, there will be no way for the plugins
    to validate the CloudBees user credentials so the reminder will always be displayed. As the full functionality
    of the CloudBees plugins requires access to the CloudBees servers, permanently suppressing the reminder in
    such cases may be required. To suppress the reminder, select this option.
